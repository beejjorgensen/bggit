## How to use your template

1. Open the PDF or PNG file for the Paperback Book Cover Template in
   your image editing software.
2. Create a new layer in your image editing software. This layer will
   serve as the design layer.
3. Design your cover in the design layer, using the template PDF or PNG
   file as the guide layer. The artwork should extend to the outside
   edge of the template's pink zone to ensure a white border will not
   exist within the printed work. Do not move the guide layer, as it is
   properly aligned for our printing specifications.
4. Ensure text and/or images that are intended to be read do not appear
   in the pink zones of the template.
5. The barcode area is indicated in yellow on the template. Do not place
   important images or text intended to be read in the barcode location.
   We suggest filling in this area with your background color or design.
   KDP will automatically generate a barcode representing your titleâ€™s
   ISBN when printing copies of your book.
6. Once your design is complete, you will need to turn off the guide
   layer so that it is not printed on your final product or rejected
   during the review process. If you are unable to turn off the guide
   layer, then you will need to format the artwork so that it completely
   covers the guide layer.
7. Flatten all layers, save the file as a press quality PDF with CMYK
   color profile, and upload the file via KDP.
