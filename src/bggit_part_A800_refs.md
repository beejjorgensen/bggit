# Appendix: Other References

[i[Reference Material]<]

**"Your book stinks. What other references can I use?"**

Here are more! I found these by searching the Internet for Git book
recommendations. The only ones I've used are the man pages and *Pro
Git*.

[i[Reference Material-->`man` pages]]

* **The man pages**
  * If you have the manual pages (historically known as the "man pages")
    installed on your system, and you probably do, you can get help for
    particular Git commands right from the command line.

    For example, if you want to know about `git config`, you can type:

    ``` {.default}
    $ man git-config
    ```

    (The minus between "git" and "config" might or might not be required
    depending on your system, but I've never found a place where it
    doesn't work.)

    Once you're in there, the arrow keys, space bar, and page up/down
    probably work to navigate, and hitting `q` or `Escape` probably
    quits. It depends on the pager your system uses.

    These manual pages are very comprehensive, and don't tend to be easy
    to read. But all the information is there! They can also be found in
    _The Git Reference Manual_, below.
