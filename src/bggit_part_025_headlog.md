# The Git Log and `HEAD`

[i[Log]]

When we make commits to a Git repo, it tracks each of those commits in a
log that you can visit. Let's take a look at that now.

## An Example Log

You can get the commit log by typing `git log`.

Let's say I'm in a repo with a single commit where I've just added a
file with the commit message "Added".

``` {.default}
$ git log
```

produces:

``` {.default}
commit 5a02fede3007edf55d18e2f9ee3e57979535e8f2 (HEAD -> main)
Author: User Name <user@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 1 09:24:52 2024 -0800

    Added
```

If I make another commit, we get a longer log:

``` {.default}
commit 5e8cb52cb813a371a11f75050ac2d7b9e15e4751 (HEAD -> main)
Author: User Name <user@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 1 12:36:13 2024 -0800

    More output

commit 5a02fede3007edf55d18e2f9ee3e57979535e8f2
Author: User Name <user@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 1 09:24:52 2024 -0800

    Added
```

Notice that the most recent commit entry is at the top of the output.

## What's in the log?

There are a few things to notice in the log:

* The commit comment
* The date
* The user who made the commit

Also, we have those huge
[fl[hex|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal]] numbers after the
word `commit`.

This is the _commit ID_ or _commit hash_. This is universally unique
number that you can use to identify a particular commit.

Normally you don't need to know this, but it can be useful for going
back in time or keeping track of commits in multi-developer projects.

We also see a bit at the top that says `(HEAD -> main)`. What's that
about?

## The `HEAD` Reference

[i[`HEAD`]]

We've seen that each commit has a unique and unwieldy identifier like
this:

`5a02fede3007edf55d18e2f9ee3e57979535e8f2`

Luckily, there are a few ways to refer to commits with more human
symbolic names.

`HEAD` is one of these references. It indicates which branch or commit
you're looking at right now in your project subdirectory. Remember how
we said you could go look at previous commits? The way you do that is by
moving `HEAD` to them.

Some terminology: the files in your git subdirectory you're looking at
right now is referred to as your _working tree_. The working tree is the
files as they appear at the commit pointed to by `HEAD`, plus any
uncommitted changes you might have made.

So if you switch `HEAD` to another commit, the files in your working
tree will be updated to reflect that.

Okay then, how do we know which commit `HEAD` is referring to? Well,
it's right there at the top of the log:

``` {.default}
commit 5e8cb52cb813a371a11f75050ac2d7b9e15e4751 (HEAD -> main)
Author: User Name <user@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 1 12:36:13 2024 -0800

    More output
```

We see `HEAD` right there on the first line, indicating that `HEAD` is
referring to commit with ID:

`5e8cb52cb813a371a11f75050ac2d7b9e15e4751`

Again, that's a bit of a lie. The `HEAD -> main` means that
`HEAD` is actually referring to the `main` branch, and that `main` is
referring to the commit. `HEAD` is therefore indirectly referring to the
commit. More on that later.

## Going Back In Time and Detached `HEAD`

[i[`HEAD`-->Detached]]

Here's my full Git log:

``` {.default}
commit 5e8cb52cb813a371a11f75050ac2d7b9e15e4751 (HEAD -> main)
Author: User Name <user@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 1 12:36:13 2024 -0800

    More output

commit 5a02fede3007edf55d18e2f9ee3e57979535e8f2
Author: User Name <user@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 1 09:24:52 2024 -0800

    Added
```

If I look at the files, I'll see the changes indicated by the "More
output" commit. But let's say I want to go back in time to the previous
commit and see what the files looked like then. How would I do that?

> **Maybe there were some changes that existed back in an earlier
> commit** that had since been removed, and you wanted to look at them,
> for example.

I can use the [i[`git checkout`]] `git checkout` command to make that
happen.

Let's checkout the first commit, the one with ID
`5a02fede3007edf55d18e2f9ee3e57979535e8f2`.

Now, I could say:

``` {.default}
$ git checkout 5a02fede3007edf55d18e2f9ee3e57979535e8f2
```

and that would work, but the rule is that you must specific at least 4
unique digits of the ID, so I could have also done this:

``` {.default}
$ git checkout 5a02
```

for the same result.

And that result is:

``` {.default}
Note: switching to '5a02'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make
experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any
commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by
switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create,
you may do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command.
Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead
to false

HEAD is now at 5a02fed Added
```

Looks sort of scary, but lookâ€”Git is telling us how to undo the
operation if we want, and so there's really nothing to fear.

Let's take a look around with `git log`:

``` {.default}
commit 5a02fede3007edf55d18e2f9ee3e57979535e8f2 (HEAD)
Author: User <user@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 1 09:24:52 2024 -0800

    Added
```

That's all! Just one commit?! Where's the second commit I made? Is it
gone forever?!

No. Everything is fine.

When you have `HEAD` at a certain commit, you're looking at the world as
it looked at that snapshot in time. Future commits haven't "happened"
yet from this perspective. They are still out there, but you'll have to
change back to them by name.

Also, do you see anything different about that first line that reads
`(HEAD)`? That's right: no `main` to be seen.

That's because the `main` branch is still looking at the latest commit,
the one with the "More output" comment. So we don't see it from this
perspective.

> **Remember earlier when I said it was a bit of a lie to say that
> `HEAD` points to a commit?** Well, detached head state is the case

Let's get back to the `main` branch. There are three options:

1. `git switch -`, just like the helpful message says.
2. `git switch main`
3. `git checkout main`

Git replies:

``` {.default}
Previous HEAD position was 5a02fed Added
Switched to branch 'main'
```

And now if we `git log`, we see all our changes again:

``` {.default}
commit 5e8cb52cb813a371a11f75050ac2d7b9e15e4751 (HEAD -> main)
Author: User Name <user@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 1 12:36:13 2024 -0800

    More output

commit 5a02fede3007edf55d18e2f9ee3e57979535e8f2
Author: User Name <user@example.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 1 09:24:52 2024 -0800

    Added
```

and our working tree will be updated to show the files as they are in
the `main` commit.

## The New Command: `git switch`

[i[`git switch`]]

In ye olden days, `git checkout` did a lot of things, and it still
does. Because it does so much, the maintainers of Git have been trying
to break some of that functionality into a new command, `git switch`.

We could redo the previous section by using just `git switch` instead of
`git checkout`. Let's try:

``` {.default}
$ git switch 5a02
```

and it says:

``` {.default}
fatal: a branch is expected, got commit '5a02'
hint: If you want to detach HEAD at the commit, try again with the
      --detach option.
```

Hmmm! `git switch` is warning us that we're about to go into detached
head state, and is that what we really want? It's not a crime or
anything to do so, but it's just letting us know that we're not going to
be on a branch any longer.

So we can override, just like it suggests:

``` {.default}
$ git switch --detach 5a02
  HEAD is now at 5a02fed Added
```

All right! No big message about being detached, but we don't need it
because we know it's detached since we specified.

And like before, we can get back to the `main` branch with either:

1. `git switch -`, switch to the previous state
2. `git switch main`

Easy.

## Commits Relative to `HEAD`

There are a couple shortcuts to get to commits that are earlier than
`HEAD`, like, "I want to switch to the 3rd commit before this one."

Here's a pretty useless example that we'll start with:

``` {.default}
$ git switch --detach HEAD
```

This moves `HEAD` to where `HEAD` was. That is, it moves it nowhere.
(Though it does have the effect of detaching it from the branch.)

But what if I wanted to move to the commit right *before* where `HEAD`
is now? You can do it with ***caret notation*** like this:

``` {.default}
$ git switch --detach HEAD^
```

And that gets you to the previous commit.

What if you wanted to get to the _third-previous_ commit? You can add
more carets!

``` {.default}
$ git switch --detach HEAD^^^
```

Or the 10th previous commit!

``` {.default}
$ git switch --detach HEAD^^^^^^^^^^
```

Or the 100th previous commit!

``` {.default}
$ git switch --detach HEAD^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^forget this
```

Typing all these carets is wearing me out. Luckily there's *another*
shorthand we have at our disposal with ***tilde notation***. The two
following lines are equivalent:

``` {.default}
$ git switch --detach HEAD^^^
$ git switch --detach HEAD~3
```

After the tilde, you can just give the number of commits back you want
to go. So back to my example:

``` {.default}
$ git switch --detach HEAD~100   # Much easier
```

All this said, personally I usually just look at the log and go to a
specific commit instead of counting back.
