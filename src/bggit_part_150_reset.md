# Reset: Moving Branches Around {#reset}

[i[Reset]<]

Before we begin, using `git reset` ***rewrites history***. This means
that you shouldn't use it on any branches that other people might have
copies of, i.e. branches that you have pushed.

Of course, this is a highly-recommended guideline, not a rule, and you
can reset anything provided you know what you're doing and have good
communication with your team.

But if you never reset a branch you haven't pushed, you won't get into
trouble.

So what is it?

Doing a reset allows you change where the `HEAD` and your current branch
point to. You can move your current branch to a different commit!

When you move a branch to another commit, the branch "becomes" the repo
at the point of that commit, including all the history that led up to
that commit. The upshot is that all the commits that led to the old
branch point are now effectively gone, as shown in Figure 18.1.

![If we reset `main` to commit _2_, commits _3_ and _4_ will eventually be lost.](img_150_010.pdf "If we reset main to commit 2, commits 3 and 4 will eventually be lost.")

So be sure you mean it when you reset! You'll be losing commits[^d563]!

[^d563]: Git cleans up "unreachable" commits after some time has
    elapsed, so they won't be *instantly* destroyed. But they're on
    borrowed time unless you create a new branch to hold them.

When doing a reset, you can ask Git to move the current branch to
another commit, or to another branch, or to anything else that
identifies a commit.

Now, there is a question of what happens to the _difference_ between
your working tree at the old commit and whatever it would be at the new
commit.

And there we have some options: ***soft reset***, ***mixed reset***, and
***hard reset***.

And which you choose controls what happens to the branch, the stage, and
the working tree.

Note: in the following examples, I'm going to use the term "old commit"
to refer to where the branch was *before* the reset, and "new commit" to
refer to where it will be *after* the reset.

With all three variants, the current branch moves to the new (specified)
commit.

The summary of differences is:

* **Soft**:
  * Stage: old commit
  * Working tree: old commit

* **Mixed**:
  * Stage: new commit
  * Working tree: old commit
  
* **Hard**:
  * Stage: new commit
  * Working tree: new commit

## Soft Reset

[i[Reset-->Soft]<]

When you run a `git reset --soft`, this resets the current branch to
point to the given commit, and makes the stage and working tree both
have the changes that were present in the old commit.

The upshot is that `git status` will show your old commit's changes as
staged, and none of the files as modified.

In other words, you'll see the old state of your files on the stage
ready to commit.

A common use for this might be to collapse some of your previous
commits similar to what we did with [rebase and squashing
commits](#squashing-commits).

Let's say we have commits like this (pretend the numbers are the commit
hashes):

``` {.default}
commit 555 (HEAD -> main)
   Fixed another typo again
commit 444
   Fixed another typo
commit 333
   Fixed a typo
commit 222
   Implemented feature
commit 111
   Added
```

That's a gnarly-looking commit history. It would be nice to rewrite it
(*but if and only if you haven't pushed it yet!*).

We can do that with a soft reset back to commit `111`.

If we do this soft reset:

``` {.default}
$ git reset --soft 111   # Again, pretend 111 is the commit hash
```

We'll then be in this point with all the other commits gone...

``` {.default}
commit 111 (HEAD -> main)
   Added
```

**Except importantly** our files *as they existed in commit 555* will
now be staged and ready to commit. That means with the soft reset the
changes weren't lost, but effectively commits 222-555 are all squished
together on the stage.

So we commit them:

``` {.default}
$ git commit -m "Implemented feature"
```

And now we're here with a nice commit history:
 
``` {.default}
commit 222 (HEAD -> main)
   Implemented feature
commit 111
   Added
```

And now, finally we can push, happy that our changes are presentable to
the general public.

> **Again, we've rewritten history here.** Don't do this if you've
> already pushed those commits past the one you're resetting to.

[i[Reset-->Soft]>]

## Mixed Reset

[i[Reset-->Mixed]<]

When you run a `git reset --mixed`[^2472], this resets the current
branch to point to the given commit, and it modifies the stage to that
commit, and it **doesn't** change your working tree.

[^2472]: You can leave off the `--mixed` since it's the default.

The upshot is that it will show files as "modified" with the changes of
the old commit, and there will be nothing on the stage.

Now, thinking about this, since the branch has moved to a commit with
your files in one state, but your working tree has the files in another
state, the files must be _modified_ with respect to the commit the
branch now points to.

And this is what happens. Your changes at the old commit will show up as
modified files at the current commit.

It's like the soft reset, except instead of the old commit ending up on
the stage, it ends up in the working tree. You can stage it and commit
it from here.

But that's not all! Since the stage is also updated to the new commit,
it means the stage is effectively emptied.

In fact, this is the classic use for a mixed reset: `git reset HEAD`.
This moves files from staged state back to modified state.

> **In the glorious future past, a new command was introduced to do
> this**: `git restore --staged`. That's the preferred method to use
> now.

This will reset the current branch to where it already was (assuming
`HEAD` points to the current branch), and reset the stage to be the same
as that commit. This unstages the files that were there. And it changes
the working tree files to have the changes that were already present in
those files at that point, which would be any changes you introduced.

And that unstages the files!

Another use might be if you want to squash a bunch of unpushed commits
but simply don't want to stage the changes at the old commit yet,
leaving them as modified.

[i[Reset-->Mixed]>]

## Hard Reset

[i[Reset-->Hard]<]

This resets everything to a particular commit. The branch moves there.
The stage is set to that commit. The files in the working tree are set
to that commit. All changes since that commit are lost.

Use this if you want to bail out. You've made some commits and decided
that was the wrong way, and you want to just roll them back entirely.

**Again, only do this if you haven't pushed!**

If you do a hard reset, it will simply move the branch and reset your
entire world (as it pertains to that branch) to that point as if nothing
had happened since. `git status` will report that everything is clean.

## Reset to a Divergent Branch

In the above examples, we've been resetting to a direct ancestor of our
current commit. This is the common case for using `git reset`.

But there's no reason why you couldn't reset to an entirely different
divergent branch. It just moves the branch there with exactly the same
rules for soft, mixed, and hard that we've already covered.

[i[Reset-->Hard]>]

## Resetting Files

[i[Reset-->Files]<]

So far, we've been just doing resets on a commit-by-commit basis. But we
could also do mixed resets with specific files. We can't do hard or soft
resets with specific files, thoughâ€”sorry!

For example, we can do a mixed reset to unstage a single file.

Let's say we're here:

``` {.default}
$ git status
  On branch main
  Changes to be committed:
    (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	  modified:   bar.txt
	  modified:   foo.txt
```

And we want to reset `foo.txt` off the stage, but leave `bar.txt` on
there.

> **Again, we'd use `git restore --staged` in these modern times.** But
> we're going to press on here for the sake of example.

So let's specify just that file:

``` {.default}
$ git reset foo.txt
  Unstaged changes after reset:
  M	foo.txt

$ git status
  On branch main
  Changes to be committed:
    (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	  modified:   bar.txt

  Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working
    directory)
	  modified:   foo.txt
```

And there you have it.

## Pushing Branch Changes to a Remote

[i[Reset-->Pushing to remote]<]

Let's say you've made a mess of things somehow and you have to reset a
branch that you've already pushed commits on. That is, you have to
rewrite a public history.

***First: get good communication with the team.*** They're going to make
fun of you for sure, but at least they won't hate you[^d100].

[^d100]: No guarantees. You shouldn't rewrite commit history that is
    already public!! It makes a big mess!

> ***Never do a forced push without completely understanding *why*
> you're doing it.*** Git is trying to stop you from doing a push for a
> reason: your own good! Everyone else who has cloned the repo will very
> likely be impacted and they need to be informed. Everybody. We use it
> here to demonstrate when it is necessary.

Our process will be something like this:

1. Do the reset.
2. Do a forced push to your remote. For your protection, Git won't push
   in this circumstance. You have to override with a forced push.

Your coworkers will do something like this:

1. [i[Fetch]]Do a `git fetch` to get the new branch position from the
   remote.
2. Stash or commit any local changes they need to preserve.
3. Maybe make a new branch at the old branch point in case they need to
   return to see old soon-to-be-obliterated commits.
4. Do a reset of the branch in question to the remote branch commit. For
   example, if we're resetting the `main` branch, you would
   `git reset --hard origin/main`.
5. Pop their changes from the stash, if any.
6. Maybe apply earlier commits that got obliterated[^318a].

[^318a]: Perhaps using `git reflog` and `git cherry-pick` or `git
    cherry-pick -n` and potentially `git add -p`, all of which are
    covered in later chapters. Along with judicious use of rebase, old
    commits or parts of old commits can be applied while keeping the
    commit history clean.

Note that your coworkers don't necessarily need to do a hard reset; they
could do a mixed reset, for instance.

[i[Reset-->Pushing to remote]>]

### Forcing the Push

[i[Push-->Forced]<]

We have basically two options to use with `git push` here:

1. `--force`: Just push the new branch position, [flw[damn the
   torpedoes|Battle_of_Mobile_Bay#"Damn_the_torpedoes"]].
2. `--force-with-lease`: Only force push if the remote branch's position
   is what we expect. In other words, **don't** force push if someone
   else has pushed a new commit in the meantime. This is a good safety measure
   because no one should have pushed a new commit in the meantime since
   you've been in communication with your team about this. ***Right?***

If you try to `--force-with-lease` and someone else has pushed another
commit to this branch in the meantime, you'll be presented with an
error:

``` {.default}
$ git push --force-with-lease
  To git@github.com:user/repo.git
   ! [rejected]        main -> main (stale info)
  error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:user/repo.git'
```

If that happens, you'll have to talk to your team to get them to stop,
and then pull the changes, make sure everyone is on board with the new
reset, and then start again.

We'll use `--force-with-lease` in our examples.

### Example: Rewrite Public History

First, let's play the part of the person who is rewriting the public
history.

***The very first thing I'm going to do is coordinate with the team.***
If you're already past this point, do it **right now**.

Then we'll start the rewrite. We'll be on the `main` branch for this
demo. Let's reset to an earlier commit, and we'll assume that these
commits we're resetting past are already public and other team members
already have them.

``` {.default}
$ git reset --hard 4849e6
  HEAD is now at 4849e65 added line 3
```

So far no harm, but now we're going to push this history change to our
origin. And we'll use `--force-with-lease` for safety.

``` {.default}
$ git push --force-with-lease
  To git@github.com:user/repo.git
   + a2b7ac3...ce44516 main -> main (forced update)
```

Now we've publicly rewritten history. Tell the team, which you've been
in contact with this entire time, that you've done so. And they can
begin to fix up their clones with much grumbling.

### Example: Receiving Rewritten History

You've just received word from your coworker that public history on the
`main` branch has been rewritten and pushed to the remote, which we'll
assume is `origin` for this example.

First thing we should do is make sure we're all backed up in whatever
manner we need.

Perhaps a commit of the latest stuff:

``` {.default}
$ git add [all files]
$ git commit -m "last commit before public reset"
```

Or a stash if we're not ready to commit:

``` {.default}
$ git stash
```

And perhaps make a new branch right here so we can revisit the old state
of affairs for reference if we have to:

``` {.default}
$ git branch oldmain
```

And now it's time for action. [i[Fetch]] We need to fetch the new branch
information.

``` {.default}
$ git fetch origin
  From git@github.com:user/repo.git
   + e7b133a...521a873 main       -> origin/main  (forced update)
```

We just fetched, so our clone doesn't look different to us yet. But
let's put an end to that and get on the same page as `origin`. This
involves resetting our local `main` to be the same as it is on the
remote tracking branch `origin/main`. (Remember the latter has been
force pushed to a different commit, and we want our `main` to point to
that commit, as well.)

Assuming we're on branch `main` right now:

``` {.default}
$ git reset --hard origin/main
```

And now we're on the same page as `origin`.

If we had stashed things, let's try to get them back, resolving any
conflicts as per usual:

``` {.default}
$ git stash pop
```

And if you want to refer to any old commits and you set up the `oldmain`
branch as above, you can `git switch oldmain` to examine them, and maybe
use something like `git cherry-pick` to bring in any functionality you
need.

[i[Push-->Forced]>]

## Resetting Without Moving `HEAD`

[i[Branch-->Moving]<]

Using the reset feature moves the `HEAD` around by necessity. What if
you just want to move a branch to another commit but leave `HEAD` alone?

It can be done! But you can't do it with a branch you have checked out
right now. So either detach the head or attach it to a different branch.

Instead of using `git reset` to do this, we'll use `git branch`. Here's
an example:

``` {.default}
$ git switch topic1
  Switched to branch 'topic1'

$ git log
  commit 97c4da49eda8de7b273003515a660945c (HEAD -> topic1)
  Author: User <user@example.com>
  Date:   Thu Aug 1 14:22:39 2024 -0700

      fix a third typo

$ git branch --force main
$ git log
  commit 97c4da49eda8de7b273003515a660945c (HEAD -> topic1, main)
  Author: User <user@example.com>
  Date:   Thu Aug 1 14:22:39 2024 -0700

      fix a third typo
```

See what happened to `main`? It moved to the current commit! You can see
it in the output for the second `git log`.

You could also specify a destination for `main` as a second argument if
you wanted it to move somewhere other than your current location.

[i[Branch-->Moving]>]

## Resetting to Remove Credentials

Did you accidentally commit some secret password into your repo? Can you
use `git reset` to back out of that commit?

* Have you pushed? Then **NO**. Your password is out in the wild. Change
  it now and never make that mistake again.
* Have you *not yet* pushed? **Yes**. You can do it. But keep in mind
  the commit containing the password will remain in your local repo
  until it is garbage collected.

If the answer was yes, you might find `git reset -p` useful to
selectively reset parts of commits, something we'll cover in a later
chapter.
